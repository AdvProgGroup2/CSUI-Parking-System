Register page

@author yohanafransiska

This is the register page that I have converted from the PHP file that
I did in the first sprint. Now the register page has already connected with the
database. It validates whether the users filled the information. If it is empty,
the program will ask for the user to fill in their information and not let any
of the field empty. 

Based on the database, the primary key is the NPM therefore there should not be 
any duplication for the NPM. However, I added another information that also must
be unique which is the username. It is validated in the 'insertdata' method from
the connectDb class. If the username is duplicated also, they must choose a new
username that does not already exist in the database.

I have made a connection between the Java file and the database, therefore whenever their is a student/staff that registers, their information is instantly inserted into the database. I also made a method that prevents any information duplication based on the data inserted in the database.
